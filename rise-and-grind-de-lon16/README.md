The Rise and Grind ETL Pipeline for SuperCafe

**Elevator pitch**

For SuperCafe

Who are struggling to manage their transaction data and identify trends across their multiple branches.

The Rise and Grind app is a fully scalable data management software using ETL pipelines to monitor operational metrics.

That is capable of handling large volumes of transactional data generated by each cafe and collates it into one place, making it easy to analyse the trends and action meaningful insights.

Unlike their current setup, which handles each branch individually via CSV files uploaded at specific times from software installed in house

Our product will extract and store the data from all branches every night and prepare the data for use in data analysis
